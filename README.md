### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
Tidied up the circles, they are now tiled evenly. I've changed some paras for easy understanding (I forgot some paras' meaning I made before lol). Will try to make the cube shapes tiling evenly, and maybe the three circles move clockwise to make a cube shape.
