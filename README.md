### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
This is a loop motion practice I made with p5.js. The circles shapes will defrom into 3D like cube shapes, back and forth. All the shapes are parameterised that can relatively keep their size with any resolutions/scales. Loop and parameterisation are two keys of this project. My goal is to make a 2D and 3D switching effect wallpaper that everything is tidy and clean, but it's a bit mess or chaos when deforming.
The basic idea comes from many satisfying loop animations and looping shapes. All these seamlessly loops can provide an endless feeling, which is so cool.
